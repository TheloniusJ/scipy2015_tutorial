    "## Strategies for dealing with missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest (and worst) way to deal with missing data is to **ignore it**. That is, simply run the analysis, missing values and all, hoping for the best. If your software is any good, this approach will simply not work; the algorithm will try to operate on data that includes missing values, and propagate them, resulting in statistics and estimates that cannot be calculated, which will typically raise errors. If your software is poor, it will make some assumption or decision about the missing values, and proceed to generate  results conditional on the assumption, which creates problems that may never be detected because no indication was given to any potential problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next easiest (worst) approach to analyzing data with missing values is to conduct list-wise deletion, by deleting the records that have missing values. This is called **complete case analysis**, because only records that are complete get retained for the analysis. The degree to which complete case analysis is undesirable depends on the mechanism by which data have become missing."

    "## Types of Missingness\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing completely at random (MCAR)**: When data are MCAR, missing cases are, on average, identical to non-missing cases, with respect to the model. Ignoring the missingness will reduce the power of the analysis, but will not bias inference.\n",
    "- **Missing at random (MAR)**: Missing data depends (usually probabilistically) on measured values, and hence can be modeled by variables observed in the data set. Accounting for the values which “cause” the missing data will produce unbiased results in an analysis.\n",
    "- **Missing not at random(MNAR)**: Missing data depend on unmeasured or unknown variables. There is no information available to account for the missingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The very best-case scenario for using complete case analysis, which corresponds to MCAR missingness, results in a **loss of power** due to the reduction in sample size. The analysis will lose the information contained in the non-missing elements of a partially-missing record. When data are not missing completely at random, inferences from complete case analysis may be **biased** due to systematic differences between missing and non-missing records that affects the estimates of key parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One alternative to complete case analysis is to simply fill (*impute*) the missing values with a reasonable guess a the true value, such as the mean, median or modal value of the fully-observed records. This imputation, while not recovering any information regarding the missing value itself for use in the analysis, does provide a mechanism for including the non-missing values in the analysis, thereby making use of all available information.\n",

It is conceptually and mechanistically straightforward, and produces complete datasets that may be analyzed using any statistical methodology or software one chooses, as if the data had no missing values to begin with.\n",

This regression model will help us generate reasonable values, particularly if data are MAR, since it uses information in the dataset that may be informative in predicting what the true value may be. Ideally, we want predictor variables that are **correlated** with the missing variable, and with the mechanism of missingness, if any. For example, one might be able to use test scores from one subject to predict missing test scores from another; or, the probability of income reporting to be missing may vary systematically according to the education level of the individual."
